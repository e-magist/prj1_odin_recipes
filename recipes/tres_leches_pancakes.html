    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup evaporated milk</li>
      <li>1/3 cup half and half</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pancakes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 (15.25 oz) box French vanilla cake mix (such as Betty Crocker™ Super
        Moist French Vanilla Cake Mix)
      </li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups almond milk</li>
      <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 cup whipped cream, or as needed (optional)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or as needed (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>
        Combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and half and half in
        a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring
        constantly for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. This is a
        sauce, not a syrup, so consistency will be on the thinner side.
      </p>
      <li>Step 2</li>
      <p>
        Add cake mix, almond milk, eggs, and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil to a
        large bowl, and beat vigorously by hand for 2 minutes.
      </p>
      <li>Step 3</li>
      <p>
        Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and lightly coat with
        remaining vegetable oil. Add 1/4 cup of the batter for each pancake.
        Cook until edges begin to puff up, small bubbles appear, pop, and leave
        small holes, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown
        on the other side, about 2 minutes more.
      </p>
      <li>Step 4</li>
      <p>
        Serve pancakes warm with a drizzle of the tres leches sauce, a dollop of
        whipped cream, and sprinkle of cinnamon.
      </p>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cook's note:</h2>
    <p>
      The tres leches sauce is very sweet, so I’d suggest that you start with
      just a drizzle, taste, and add more if desired. This recipe yields 18 to
      20 pancakes.
